The Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer is a simple, console-based C# application designed to help astronauts plan and manage their daily tasks effectively. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts and implements software design patterns such as the Singleton Pattern, Factory Pattern,  to ensure maintainable, scalable, and high-quality code.
The application allows users to:
•	Add new tasks with descriptions, start and end times, and priority levels.
•	Remove tasks by name.
•	View all tasks sorted by start time.
•	Prevent overlapping tasks with conflict detection.
•	Provide clear error messages for invalid operations.
